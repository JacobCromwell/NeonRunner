# Open Questions

Questions that need the owner's answer. Sorted on October 14, 2026, when the list had grown to 794 items: the owner
is happy with the gameplay, so everything whose placeholder works moved out.

Item numbers are permanent: code comments, tests and the GDD cite them ("`docs/OPEN_QUESTIONS.md` item 628", "FB 73").
An item lives in exactly one of three files, under its original heading and number:

- `docs/OPEN_QUESTIONS.md`: the few questions that need the owner (work waits on them, or the placeholder gets
  costlier to change later).
- `docs/OPEN_QUESTIONS_DEFERRED.md`: still technically open, but the placeholder works and nothing waits on it
  (tuning, names, looks, feel). **The placeholder stands as built** until the owner reopens it while playtesting.
- `docs/OPEN_QUESTIONS_ANSWERED.md`: answered, approved, superseded, or notes that ask nothing.

To find a cited item, search the three files: `grep -n "^628\. " docs/OPEN_QUESTIONS*.md` (build phase 2 items have
no prefix; "GB n" and "FB n" are in their own sections). **Don't read these files whole.**

**New questions** from a task go in `docs/questions/<task-id>.md` (see `CLAUDE.md`). When the task merges, the
orchestrator gives each one the next free number (**825** after task E5e; raise it here when you use one) and files it
here only if work waits on it or its placeholder will be costly to change later; otherwise in
`docs/OPEN_QUESTIONS_DEFERRED.md`. When the owner answers an item, record the answer in the GDD and move the item
to `docs/OPEN_QUESTIONS_ANSWERED.md` with the answer.

## Needs the owner (summary)

| Item | Question |
|---|---|
| 766 | Ceilings in the levels are too safe (owner, October 10, 2026): should only one lane be safe to drop to where a level's ceiling ends, the rest free to hold gaps, hazards or enemies? A change to the generator's rules (GDD §3, Safe landing zone). |

## The items in full

**The Beach's boss: the design session** (the owner with Claude, October 10, 2026; GDD §10, Mecha Guppy and Captain Cogs; task E5e)
766. **Ceilings in the levels are too safe** (GDD §3, Safe landing zone; owner, October 10, 2026: "often the ceiling is
    way too safe", to be revisited for the game itself). In the Beach's boss fight one safe place to drop to is enough.
    Should the levels follow: at least one safe lane where a ceiling ends, and the rest free to hold gaps, hazards or
    enemies? It is a change to the level generator's rules (a core task), so it waits for the owner's word.
