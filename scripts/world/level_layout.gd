class_name LevelLayout
extends RefCounted
## Pure-data description of one generated level, built from abstract gameplay pieces only.
## Positions along the track are distances in metres from the start (forward is positive).
## Lanes are indices 0..lane_count-1, left to right. Wall sides are -1 (left) and +1 (right).

var lane_count: int = 3
var length: float = 0.0
## {lane, start, end}: a hole in the floor segment of one lane.
var gaps: Array[Dictionary] = []
## {lane, at, variant ("full" | "gapped"), pulsing, pulse_on, pulse_off, phase}
var fences: Array[Dictionary] = []
## {side, start, end, bottom, top}: blocks wall entry along its length and hurts on contact.
var signs: Array[Dictionary] = []
## {start, end}: a ceiling section.
var hulls: Array[Dictionary] = []
## {lane, at}: anti-grav pad in a floor lane.
var pads: Array[Dictionary] = []
## {side, at}: ramp in the outermost lane on that side, launching onto the wall.
var ramps: Array[Dictionary] = []
## {lane, at}: speed pad in a floor lane (DESIGN-TBD: GDD §6 only names them).
var speed_pads: Array[Dictionary] = []
## {at, surface ("floor" | "wall" | "ceiling"), lane (floor/ceiling), side (wall), height, value}.
## `height` is the distance from the surface (floor/ceiling) or the height on the wall.
var credits: Array[Dictionary] = []
## {type, at, lane, side, seed, params}: an enemy (or destructible) for EnemyDirector.
var enemies: Array[Dictionary] = []
